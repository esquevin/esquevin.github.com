                <p>
                    Algolia has always been an impressive company to me, from the way you handled 
                    <a href="http://blog.algolia.com/postmortem-todays-8min-indexing-downtime/">an 8 minutes indexing downtime</a> to 
                    <a href="http://www.algolia.com/doc">the quality of your documentation</a> and, it goes without saying, the amazing speed and accuracy
                    of your search, I saw in algolia a company that will soon be known by everyone.</p>
                <p>
                    Your number of appearances on HN's first page makes me think I was right, you are definitely up to something great, and I would love
                    to contribute to this.
                </p>
                <p>When I saw that you were <strong>(finally)</strong> looking for a front end engineer, I knew I had to contact you =).</p>

                <h2>I am the <em>perfect</em> match</h2>
            
                <p>
                    Most of you already know me, I've helped you at your very beginning, to quickly integrate your first design. 
                    But that's not important. What I need to show you is that I've the perfect background for you :
                </p>

                <h3>Exalead 2006-2009</h3>
                <p>I was lucky enough to work at Exalead for 3 and a half years with brilliant colleagues (you included). There we rebuild the web search experience from scratch. Twice.</p>
                <p>I've designed and implemented a lot of search prototypes, having always in mind the UX, the ease of use and the performance.</p>
            
                <h3>Platypus Creation 2009-2014</h3>
                <p>
                    I created Platypus Creation because I wanted to work on something else, I wasn't learning enough at Exalead anymore, and there was no possibilities of evolutions for me there.</p>
                    Platypus allowed me to meet a lot of people, work with a lot of technologies, on brand new subjects.
                </p>
                <p>My best referal is that former Exalead colleagues keep hiring me or introducing me to their friends.</p>
            
                <p>My most relevant work are those I've done these past 12 month :</p>
                <ul class="jobs">
                    <li>
                        <a href="http://www.dataiku.com" title="Dataiku's web site">Dataiku</a>
                        <p>I have worked part-time at dataiku for the last 12 month.</p>
                        <p>
                            They contacted me to have a look at their brand new shaker web app, 
                            and the next week I had rewritten most of it from scratch using angular, 
                            setting the foundations of their data science studio.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="http://www.opendatasoft.com" title="Open Data Soft's web site">Open Data Soft</a>
                        <p>At first I've helped them turn their python/django codebase into a clean, state of the art, django web app.</p>
                        <p>Then I've rethought from scratch their publication workflow, turning 14 webpages into a single one, in angular.</p>
                        <p>Since then I've worked on almost all the aspect of their frontend, including prototyping the customizations for their prospects.</p>
                        <p>I was the one who proposed and developped their embed feature, responsible for most of their traffic nowadays.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Now <small>2014 – ?</small></h3>
                <p>I am looking for new challenges now. I miss being part of a team and am currently looking for a great startup where my experience would make a difference.</p>
                <p>Luckiky I think that I might just have found it !</p>
